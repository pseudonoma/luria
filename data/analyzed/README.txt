comparisons vs output
  Output is the one you want; contains the mutrate estimates.
  Comparisons is the measures of difference between each population's result;
  low p means the estimates are significantly different.

pooled vs unpooled
  Pooled is all Reps combined into one measure, i.e. that of AB3.
  Unpooled has all Reps separate, so no measure of AB3 per se.
  COMBINED is an artificial copy-pasting of pooled and unpooled for FIG use.

short vs long
  Short drops outliers Rep 3 and Rep 6.
  Long does not.
