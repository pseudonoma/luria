Description: This package provides a framework and data analysis pipeline for
    conducting fluctuation analysis, from wrangling raw colony count data to
    producing plots of pooled and unpooled mutation rate estimates. It is 
    built around a function originally written by the Barrick Lab, which in 
    turn uses the package rSalvador to estimate and compare mutation rates.
