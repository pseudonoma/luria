# luria

<!-- badges: start -->

This package provides a general framework and data analysis pipeline for conducting fluctuation
analysis. Its functions are built around a modification of the fluxxer.R script written by 
J. Barrick & D. Deatherage, which in turn calls functions from the rSalvador package to produce 
mutation rate estimates and comparisons. 

## Installation

To install the package, run the following lines:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pseudonoma/luria")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(luria)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
